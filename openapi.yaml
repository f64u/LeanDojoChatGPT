  title: Lean
  description: Plugin for proving user-specified theorems automatically by interacting with Lean. The user enters information of how to find a theorem (e.g., theorem name and file path). Based on the user's input, ChatGPT first initializes the proof search with the given theorem as the initial state. Then, ChatGPT will first explain the choice for the next tactic step using LaTeX and run that tactic step to the state. If the current state is not promising, ChatGPT can backtrack to previous states by decrementing the "state_id" parameter. If applying tactics to the current state specified by the "state_id" parameter returns an error message, ChatGPT should explain the error, and if repetitive errors occur, ChatGPT should decrement the "state_id" parameter and try a different approach on a previous state. The theorem is successfully proved if there is no unsolved goal in the current state.

    post:
      operationId: initialize_proof_search
      summary: Given the theorem name, file path, and a public git repo of a Lean theorem, initialize the proof search. The response includes the initial state and its state ID.

  /run_tactic:
    post:
      operationId: run_tactic
      summary: Run a tactic on a state (specified by its state ID), assuming the proof search has been initialized and some state is available. The response is either the next state and its state ID or an error message, in which ChatGPT should explain the error and consider decrementing the "state_id".
